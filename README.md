## 🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI-driven car** using a **CNN-based machine learning model**.  
The model takes real-time image feeds from the **Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator** and predicts steering angles to autonomously drive the car.  

The connection between the simulator and the Python model is established via **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)**, enabling smooth communication and real-time control.

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 **CNN Model** trained to predict steering angles from camera images  
- 🎮 **Integration with Udacity Simulator** for real-time driving  
- ⚡ **WSGI Server** to connect simulator and Python model seamlessly  
- 📊 **Training Pipeline** with data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation  
- 🚘 **Autonomous Driving Demo** inside the simulator
